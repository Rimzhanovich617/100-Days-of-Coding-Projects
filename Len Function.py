#Write a program that takes a string as input and prints out the length of the string. For
# example, if the input string is "Hello, world!", the program should output 13.
#This is a simple problem that can help beginners practice basic Python string operations and
# input/output functions.

test_string = "Hello World"
print(test_string)
print(len(test_string))
